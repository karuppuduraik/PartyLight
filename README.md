# 🎉 Party Light

A simple and colorful web animation that creates a party light effect using CSS gradients and smooth color transitions.  
Users can control the animation speed using interactive buttons.

---

## 🌈 Features

- Dynamic background color animation using CSS `@keyframes`
- Adjustable animation speed (0.5x, 1x, 2x)
- Smooth transitions with glowing effects
- Clean, minimal, and responsive design

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The background continuously changes colors through a gradient animation.
- The **Speed Control Center** allows users to modify the animation speed:
  - `0.5x` → Slow  
  - `1x` → Normal  
  - `2x` → Fast  
- The effect is achieved with JavaScript event listeners that modify the CSS `animation-duration` property.
